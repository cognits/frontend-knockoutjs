# Learning KnockoutJS

This is a step by step tutorial to learn knockoutJS.

## Why
To become a great Web Developer, you must be able to work with the latest
technologies and frameworks. KnockoutJS is part of a new generation of frameworks
that make frontend development much more easier, just like [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org).
These frameworks let you dynamically bind data with html elements.

## User Stories

### Basic (use index.html)
As a developer you should be able to bind data from input fields to html tags.

### Grocery List (use list.html)
As a shopper I must be able to see my grocery list. (use a selection field to display the list)

As a shopper I must be able to add, remove and sort my grocery list.

### Controls
As a developer you should be able to use text-fields, checkboxes, drop-down lists, multi-select
and radio buttons.

As a developer you should be able to display the values from all the fields in a separate part of
the webpage with Knockout.JS.

### People Collections
As a user I must be able to display a minimum of 3 peoples, each with 3 children as a <ul> list. (use ko.observableArray)
Example:
- Isabel tiene 3 hijos:
  - Diego
  - Fernando
  - Jose
- Ines tiene 4 hijos:
  - Juan
  - Pedro
  - Maria

As a user I must be able to add a child to any person in the people list.
